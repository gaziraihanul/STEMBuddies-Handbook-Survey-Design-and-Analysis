This project involved designing and analyzing a survey to evaluate Toronto high school students’ needs and preferences regarding the STEMBuddies handbook. The survey included both demographic and needs-assessment questions to capture students’ academic and non-academic support experiences. Using R, simulated data representing over 2,000 respondents were generated to approximate a near-census sample, enabling exploratory data analysis through descriptive tables, visualizations, and confidence interval estimation. The analysis identified key gaps in the handbook—particularly in areas such as exam preparation and mental health resources—offering actionable insights for program improvement. All procedures, from sampling and data cleaning to analysis and reporting, were documented to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility for non-technical stakeholders.
